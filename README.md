## Building instructions

### Dependencies

In designing any software package there are clear benefits and disadvantages to using libaries. In dgswem-v2, we have the following dependencies:

| Dependency | Function              |   Dependent Targets                    |
| ---------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| yaml-cpp   | YAML file parser      | All targets                            |
| Metis      | Graph partitioner     | `partitioner`                          |
| HPX        | Asynchronous Runtime  | `DG_HYPER_SWE_HPX`                     |
| OpenMP     | Application threading | `DG_HYPER_SWE_OMPI`                    |
| MPI        | Message passing       | `DG_HYPER_SWE_OMPI`,`DG_HYPER_SWE_HPX` |

To begin select a work directory. On the TACC machines we recommend using the `$WORK` directory and copying all of the meshes into `$SCRATCH` for running jobs. `yaml-cpp`, `Metis`, and `HPX` are all libraries. To assist the user in installing the Libraries we have added some bash scripts in `scripts/build` to assist the user in compiling `dgswem-v2`.

To begin the installation process, you will need to set up a configuration file. From the root of the repository, go to `scripts/build`. Open up `config.txt` and define a machine according to your preferences. Note the `build-XXXX.sh` scripts will use `config.txt` by default. However, one can also use custom configuration file as follows:
```sh
    ./build-XXXX.sh -c custom_config.txt
```
Note that for HPX, the library's build-type must be consistent with the applications build-type.

#### Installing `yaml-cpp`

From `$WORK` (as defined in the configuration file)
```sh
    git clone git@github.com:jbeder/yaml-cpp.git
    cd /path/to/build/scripts/
    ./build-yaml-cpp.sh
```
#### Installing `hpx`

The building of hpx requires a lot of dependencies. In particular, for our bash script, we require that jemalloc, boost, hwloc, and an MPI implementation be installed. Note that most clusters typically come installed with boost, hwloc, and an MPI implementation. Thus, if you have already have installed versions of the afore mentioned libraries, skip the relevant build scripts.
```sh
    cd $WORK
    git clone https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx
    cd /path/to/build/scripts
    ./build-hwloc.sh
    ./build-boost.sh
    ./build-jemalloc.sh
    ./build-hpx.sh
```

### Building the Application

Assuming that `${INSTALL_PATH}` is the path defined in the configuration file. The dgswemv2 uses an out of source build. The application can be built as follows:
```sh
    cd /path/to/dgswemv2/
    mkdir build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<build type> -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${INSTALL_PATH} ..
```
Note that there are some additional options, which will create additional targets. These typically require additional dependencies.

| CMake Option | Description                                                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| USE_OMPI     | Enables MPI OpenMP parallelization; builds target `DG_HYPER_SWE_OMPI` |
| USE_HPX      | Enables HPX parallelization; builds target `DG_HYPER_SWE_HPX`         |
| SET_VERBOSE  | Set the makefile compilation output to Verbose                        |

Note that the two parallel targets are not mutually exclusive. Cmake should be able to build the two targets without any conflicts.
